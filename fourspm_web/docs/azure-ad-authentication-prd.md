# Azure AD Authentication Implementation - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for implementing Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication in the FourSPM_Web application. The FourSPM_Web application currently uses a custom token-based authentication system with a local API. This PRD details the requirements for transitioning to Azure AD authentication to improve security, enable single sign-on capabilities, and better align with modern enterprise authentication standards.

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for implementing Azure AD authentication in the FourSPM_Web application. This document will serve as a guide for developers, testers, and stakeholders involved in the implementation process.

### 1.2 Scope

This PRD covers the authentication and authorization requirements for the FourSPM_Web application, including:
- Azure AD configuration
- Frontend implementation
- Backend implementation
- User experience considerations
- Testing requirements

### 1.3 References

- Azure AD documentation
- Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) documentation
- FourSPM_Web application architecture documentation
- Blueprints-web Azure AD implementation (reference implementation)

## 2. Product overview

FourSPM_Web is a React-based web application for project management that requires secure authentication. The application is currently hosted at both `http://localhost:3000` (development) and `https://app.4spm.org` (production) with the backend WebService at `https://localhost:7246` and `https://api.4spm.org` respectively.

The authentication implementation will use the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) on the frontend and Microsoft.Identity.Web on the backend to provide a seamless, standards-compliant authentication experience for users.

### 2.1 Current authentication system

The current authentication system uses a custom token-based approach with endpoints like:
- `LOGIN_ENDPOINT: ${API_CONFIG.baseUrl}${API_CONFIG.endpoints.login}`
- `LOGOUT_ENDPOINT: ${API_CONFIG.baseUrl}${API_CONFIG.endpoints.logout}`

Users authenticate by submitting credentials to the login endpoint, which returns a JWT token stored in localStorage. This token is then included in subsequent API requests for authorization.

### 2.2 Proposed authentication system

The proposed system will use Azure AD for authentication, with MSAL for token acquisition and management. This will enable:
- Single sign-on with Microsoft accounts
- Multi-factor authentication capabilities
- Centralized user management
- Enhanced security features
- Role-based access control through Azure AD groups and app roles
