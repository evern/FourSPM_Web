# Azure AD Authentication Functional Requirements

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the functional requirements for implementing Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication in the FourSPM_Web application.

## 2. Authentication Requirements

### 2.1 User Authentication
| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| AUTH-1 | The system shall authenticate users via Azure Active Directory |
| AUTH-2 | The system shall support single sign-on (SSO) for users with existing Microsoft accounts |
| AUTH-3 | The system shall support both development (localhost:3000) and production (app.4spm.org) environments |
| AUTH-4 | The system shall maintain authentication state across page refreshes |

### 2.2 Authorization & Access Control
| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| AUTHZ-1 | The system shall support role-based access control with at least two permission levels: User and Admin |
| AUTHZ-2 | The system shall validate access tokens for all API requests to protected resources |
| AUTHZ-3 | The system shall enforce scope-based permissions for API access |
| AUTHZ-4 | The system shall prevent unauthorized access to protected routes and API endpoints |

### 2.3 Token Management
| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| TOKEN-1 | The system shall securely store authentication tokens in browser session storage |
| TOKEN-2 | The system shall automatically refresh tokens before expiration |
| TOKEN-3 | The system shall handle token expiration gracefully by redirecting to login |
| TOKEN-4 | The system shall include valid tokens in all API requests to protected endpoints |

### 2.4 User Experience
| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| UX-1 | The system shall provide login and logout functionality in the user interface |
| UX-2 | The system shall display appropriate error messages for authentication failures |
| UX-3 | The system shall redirect users to appropriate pages after successful login |
| UX-4 | The system shall maintain the user's session according to Azure AD token lifetimes |
| UX-5 | The system shall support popup-based authentication for a seamless user experience |

### 2.5 Security
| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| SEC-1 | The system shall not store user passwords locally |
| SEC-2 | The system shall validate tokens on both client and server sides |
| SEC-3 | The system shall implement proper CORS policies for secure cross-origin requests |
| SEC-4 | The system shall clear authentication state upon logout |

## 3. Technical Integration Requirements

### 3.1 Frontend Integration
| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FE-1 | The frontend shall integrate with Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for authentication flows |
| FE-2 | The frontend shall implement context providers for authentication state management |
| FE-3 | The frontend shall include authentication tokens in all API requests to the backend |
| FE-4 | The frontend shall handle authentication errors gracefully |

### 3.2 Backend Integration
| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| BE-1 | The backend shall validate Azure AD tokens on all protected API endpoints |
| BE-2 | The backend shall configure JWT Bearer authentication using Microsoft.Identity.Web |
| BE-3 | The backend shall implement proper CORS configuration for the frontend application |
| BE-4 | The backend shall extract user claims from tokens for authorization decisions |

## 4. Compliance & Configuration Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| CONF-1 | The system shall be configurable for different environments (development, test, production) |
| CONF-2 | The system shall properly register a single Azure AD application with both SPA and API configurations |
| CONF-3 | The system shall expose required API scopes (Application.User, Application.Admin) |
| CONF-4 | The system shall grant appropriate self-permissions for API access |
