      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "MSAL Library Integration and Configuration",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the MSAL integration into subtasks such as: installing packages, creating the configuration file, updating environment variables, setting up the provider in the app root, and verifying configuration in different environments.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard library integration and configuration steps, which are well-documented and commonly performed in React applications using MSAL. While it requires attention to detail for environment-specific settings and correct provider setup, it does not involve complex logic or custom flows. The work is modular and can be split into clear subtasks for installation, configuration, environment setup, provider integration, and verification.[1][3][5]"

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Authentication Context Refactoring",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks such as: defining the new User type, implementing the AuthContext with MSAL hooks, handling authentication state and user info, implementing role-based access, updating the App component to use the new provider, and writing unit tests for context behaviors.",
      "reasoning": "Refactoring authentication context to use MSAL and support role-based access introduces moderate complexity. It requires careful state management, integration with MSAL hooks, error handling, and ensuring compatibility with the rest of the app. Testing and migration from the old provider add to the complexity, making it more involved than a simple integration."

    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "API Integration with MSAL Tokens",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose this task into subtasks such as: implementing token acquisition logic, updating API service methods for token injection, handling token refresh and errors, creating the API hook, integrating with AuthContext, testing all HTTP methods, and verifying error/refresh flows.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires secure handling of access tokens, robust error and refresh logic, and seamless integration with both MSAL and the app's API layer. It must handle edge cases like token expiry and network errors, and ensure all API calls are authenticated. The need for comprehensive testing and error handling increases its complexity."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Route Protection and Authorization",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks such as: implementing the RequireAuth component, creating the Unauthorized page, updating route definitions for protection, building the navigation with permission checks, testing role-based access, and verifying redirects and loading states.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing route protection and role-based authorization involves conditional rendering, navigation logic, and integration with authentication state. Ensuring correct access control, user feedback, and seamless user experience across different roles and states adds to the complexity."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Login Experience Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks such as: creating the login component with MSAL button, implementing silent authentication, updating the App to include silent auth, styling the login page, and testing login flows and error handling.",
      "reasoning": "Replacing the login flow with MSAL and supporting silent authentication requires understanding MSAL's authentication flows, handling UI/UX for login states, and ensuring accessibility and responsiveness. While not highly complex, it involves several moving parts and integration points."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Role Management Interface",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks such as: defining the Role type, implementing the role service, building the management UI with grid and forms, handling add/edit/delete logic, integrating with API, adding navigation to permission management, and writing UI tests.",
      "reasoning": "Building a full-featured admin interface for roles involves both frontend UI complexity (data grid, forms, modals) and backend integration (CRUD operations, error handling). Ensuring a smooth UX and robust error handling increases the complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Permission Management Interface",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks such as: defining permission types, implementing the permission service, building the permission management UI (tree view), handling selection and updates, integrating with role management, managing loading/saving states, error handling, and writing tests.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires complex UI (tree view with categories and selection), state management for permissions, integration with roles, and robust API interactions. Handling updates, tracking changes, and ensuring a responsive and intuitive interface make this one of the more complex tasks."
    },

      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks such as: implementing the Toast component, creating the ToastContainer and context, building the NetworkDetector, enhancing AuthContext for token refresh and error handling, updating API service for network errors, integrating providers in App, styling notifications, and writing comprehensive tests.",
      "reasoning": "Comprehensive error handling across authentication, network, and permissions requires cross-cutting changes, robust notification systems, and integration with multiple app layers. Ensuring graceful degradation, user feedback, and resilience to edge cases is challenging and critical for production readiness."
