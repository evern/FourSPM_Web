# Task ID: 3
# Title: Install Required Backend Packages
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure authentication services in the frontend following the FourSPM UI Development Guidelines and established API architecture patterns, including integration with React Query for token management.
# Details:
1. Implement API endpoints for authentication following the API architecture overview:
   - Create authentication controller endpoints for login, logout, and token refresh
   - Implement token validation middleware
   - Set up proper error handling for authentication failures

2. Configure token management services:
   - Implement secure token storage in the frontend
   - Create interceptors for automatic token inclusion in API requests
   - Set up token refresh logic to handle expiration

3. Integrate with React Query for authentication state management:
   - Create custom hooks for authentication operations
   - Implement query invalidation on authentication state changes
   - Set up proper caching strategies for auth-related queries

4. Follow FourSPM UI Development Guidelines for authentication UI components:
   - Implement protected routes
   - Create login/logout UI components
   - Add authentication state indicators in the UI

5. Create environment-specific configurations for development and production

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify authentication endpoints work correctly with proper request/response handling
2. Test token management functionality including storage, inclusion in requests, and refresh
3. Validate React Query integration by checking query invalidation and caching
4. Test protected routes to ensure they properly restrict access
5. Verify login/logout flows work end-to-end
6. Ensure environment-specific configurations load correctly

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify and Install Required Backend Packages [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Determine the necessary backend packages for authentication and API integration, then install them using the appropriate package manager (e.g., npm, yarn, or .NET CLI).
### Details:
Focus on packages that support React Query integration, centralized API endpoints, and context+reducer patterns as per FourSPM UI Development Guidelines.

## 2. Set Up Configuration Files [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create and configure essential files (e.g., .env, config.js, or appsettings.json) to store environment variables and authentication settings.
### Details:
Ensure configuration files include API base URLs, authentication endpoints, and any secrets required for secure communication.

## 3. Implement Environment-Specific Configurations [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Adjust configuration files and package settings to support multiple environments (development, staging, production).
### Details:
Use environment variables and conditional logic to load the correct settings based on the deployment environment.

## 4. Integrate Centralized API Endpoints [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Establish a centralized module for managing API endpoints and requests, ensuring consistency across authentication and data-fetching logic.
### Details:
Structure API calls to align with React Query integration patterns and facilitate easy updates to endpoint URLs.

## 5. Configure Context and Reducer for Authentication State [done]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Set up a React context and reducer to manage authentication state globally, following the documented FourSPM UI Development Guidelines.
### Details:
Ensure the context provides authentication status, user data, and methods for login/logout, and is integrated with React Query for data synchronization.

## 6. Verify Installation and Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Test the backend package installation, configuration files, environment-specific settings, and authentication flow to ensure everything works as expected.
### Details:
Run automated and manual tests to confirm successful authentication, correct API endpoint usage, and proper state management.
