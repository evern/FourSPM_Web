# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Role Management UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive role and permission management interface that integrates with the new RolesController backend.
# Details:
Create a Role Management UI following the established FourSPM patterns:

1. **Component Structure**:
   - Follow the two-layer component pattern with a provider wrapper and content component
   - Implement proper context separation for data vs. UI state
   - Use DevExtreme ODataGrid for the roles list

2. **State Management**:
   - Use React Query for data fetching with the new role endpoints
   - Implement proper loading states and error handling
   - Use context for local UI state management

3. **UI Components**:
   - Create a roles grid showing role name, description, and system role status
   - Implement a role editor form for adding/editing roles
   - Create a permission assignment interface with grouped checkboxes
   - Support mobile and desktop layouts with responsive design

4. **Features**:
   - CRUD operations for roles
   - Permission assignment and removal
   - System role protection (prevent editing/deleting system roles)
   - Search/filter functionality
   - Clear error messaging

5. **Integration**:
   - Add to the Administration section of the navigation
   - Ensure proper permission checks for accessing the UI
   - Handle token refresh scenarios

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify the Role Management UI follows the Collection View Doctrine
2. Test CRUD operations against the backend
3. Verify permissions can be assigned and removed
4. Test responsive design on different viewport sizes
5. Verify system roles are properly protected
6. Test error scenarios (network errors, validation errors)
7. Verify proper loading states are shown
8. Test search and filter functionality
9. Verify the UI correctly reflects permission changes

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Role Management Component Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the component hierarchy and architecture for the role management UI
### Details:
Define the component structure including parent-child relationships, reusable components, and the overall architecture. Create wireframes for role listing, role details, permission assignment, and user-role association views. Consider responsive design requirements for different screen sizes.

## 2. Implement State Management for Roles [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop state management solution for handling role data and operations
### Details:
Create state management for role CRUD operations, permission assignments, and user-role associations. Implement data fetching, caching strategies, and optimistic updates. Design state structure to efficiently handle role hierarchies and permission inheritance as described in role management systems.

## 3. Build Core UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop the essential UI components needed for role management
### Details:
Create reusable UI components including role cards, permission checkboxes, role assignment dropdowns, search/filter functionality, and confirmation dialogs. Ensure components follow design system guidelines and include proper accessibility features.

## 4. Implement Role CRUD Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.3
### Description: Develop interfaces for creating, reading, updating, and deleting roles
### Details:
Build UI screens and logic for role creation, viewing role details, editing roles, and role deletion with appropriate confirmation flows. Include validation for role names, descriptions, and permission assignments. Implement error handling and success notifications.

## 5. Develop Permission Assignment Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.4
### Description: Create interfaces for assigning and managing permissions within roles
### Details:
Implement UI for assigning permissions to roles, including hierarchical permission structures, bulk permission operations, and permission inheritance visualization. Create interfaces for testing role configurations before deployment as recommended in role management best practices.

## 6. Integrate with Navigation and User Systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.4, 16.5
### Description: Connect role management UI with navigation and user management systems
### Details:
Integrate role management with the application navigation system, implementing role-based UI adaptation. Connect with user management to enable assigning users to roles and displaying role-specific interfaces. Implement automated role assignment workflows and ensure proper authorization checks throughout the application.
